The purpose of this code is to figure out the trend of uber prices to go from point A to point B (both hard coded).
It uses Uber's API to retrieve prices and parses through it, looking for its POOL price since it has been
    guaranteed by Uber to be its cheapest option.
In the future I plan on running this every minute throughout the day and charting the change in rate.
