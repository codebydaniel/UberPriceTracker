The purpose of this code is to figure out the trend of uber prices to go from point A to point B (both hard coded).
It uses Uber's API to retrieve prices and parses through it, mapping the uber type (e.g. "POOL" and "uberX") 
  to their respective prices.
  The prices for estimates are always the higher cap for conservative reasons.
